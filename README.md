# Elevator Project:

•    Provide code that simulates an elevator. You are free to use any language.

•    Upload the completed project to GitHub (public) for discussion during interview.

•    The result should be an executable, or script, that can be run with the following inputs and generate the following outputs.

                  Inputs: [list of floors to visit] (e.g. elevator start=12 floor=2,9,1,32)

                  Outputs: [total travel time, floors visited in order] (e.g. 560 12,2,9,1,32)

                  Program Constants: Single floor travel time: 10

#Submission Instructions:

Once your project is complete, please upload it to GitHub and send me the link by the day prior to your scheduled interview. This will allow the team enough time to review your project.
